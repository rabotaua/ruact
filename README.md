# React StarterKit

Sample playground for react project

To start a new project your would like to:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rabotaua/ruact myapp
cd myapp
rm -rf .git
git init
npm install
npm start:timer
```

The main purpose is to get [react-hot-loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader) work out of the box.

Samples taken from (react-hot-boilerplate)[https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-boilerplate/tree/next] in conjunction with (react-boilerplate)[https://github.com/mxstbr/react-boilerplate] and (create-react-app)[https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/07/22/create-apps-with-no-configuration.html].

The main difference between this one and bazillion of other starter kits is that:

- we are wanting react hot loader
- we need 1+ apps inside repository

Note: if create react app project will accept latest patches from react hot loader then there is literally no need in this boilerplate.

## WebStorm notes

### Tests

ava is chosen for its concurrency, react and es6 out of the box support

- [ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava) - runner
- [react-addons-test-utils](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html) - allow write unit tests for react components (as site says toke a look at *enzyme*)
- [enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/) - makes *react-addons-test-utils* usable by adding jQuery like sugar
- [jsdom](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom) - render into memory instead of phantomjs or chrome
- [nyc](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc) - coverage
